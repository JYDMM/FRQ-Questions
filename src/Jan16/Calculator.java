*        Create a Calculator class. It should include:
*            2 fields that are doubles, double a and double b.
*            Getters and Setters for each of those.
*            A default constructor that sets both a and b equal to 1.0.
*            A constructor that takes in double parameters and stores their values in a and
*            An add method with no parameters that returns the sum of a and b.
*            An overloaded add method that is passed a Calculator object and calculates the sum of the calling
*            Calculator instance plus the sum of the Calculator object passed in. Example:
*                Calculator example1 = new Calculator (5, 9);
*                Calculator example 2 = new Calculator (-4, 17);
*            The method should add example 1 and example 2, returning 27.
*            A subtract method that returns the result of a - b.
*                An overloaded subtract method that is passed a Calculator instance, calculates the difference of
*                the passed instance, the difference of the calling instance, and returns: difference of calling
*                instance - difference of passed instance.
*            A multiply method that returns the product of a and b.
*            A divide method that returns a/b. This should include an if statement that resets b to equal 1 if b currently equals 0 (in order to avoid an arithmetic error).
*        In a main method, write the method calls for 2 of the operation methods that use the a and b of a single
*        instance to calculate the answer. Then, write the method call for at least 1 operation method that is passed
*        a Calculator object.
